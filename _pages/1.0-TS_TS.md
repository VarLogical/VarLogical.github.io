<br />
The Sword And The Sparrow was my first full game ever made. <br />
It took me about 6-8 weeks to make. <br />
I only spent only 1 night creating the levels and menu most of the work was spent <br />
creating the infrastructure of the game. This is because the game was made with <br />
lots of different levels and even enemies in mind. <br />
The cool bit is the whole world is procedurally generated it was made so that <br />
you could easily add an enemy by replacing a '0' by a letter such as 'b' for bat. <br />
Unfortunately I was over ambitious for a flash game made in 8 weeks, <br />
I ran out of time the combat never happened and I was only able to add 1 level tile and 1 enemy.<br />
Enjoy The Game.
