Crime Crew is a stealth strategy game that was the resulting effort of 3 people including myself.

The project took 14 weeks to complete and I was assigned the role of programmer/technical developer.<br>
Besides working on the coding aspects of the game I also created most of the mechanics and integrated almost all of the different parts of the game together.
